    If you are stressed, one of the more relaxed days out can be found just north of Oxford street in the Wallace collection. It's a medium sized historic house with the most sumptuous decoration and a slow atmosphere. Ask about the intricate history of the Serve porceline and the delicate furniture, some of which belonged to Mary Antoinette.

    A wonder around the National Gallery is always rewarding. As National Art collections go this one is not too big, and so it is easy to walk around the majority of it without getting 'art sick'. However, may be small compared to places like the met but it sure is packed with mazing masterpeices.

<% elsif @mood =='inspired' %>
    Take a sketch book to the V+A and try sketching some of your favourite peices. Dont spend more than 10 minites on each one, constantly move around the objects seeing them from different angles. Use only a limited amount of colours to push your skills

    A trip to Brick Lane will always shake the dust from the creative cobwwebs! Wander around he shops and markets studying the graffitti, which constantly changes. Admire the street signs whilst munching of a delicious curry before redesigning your wardrobe in the fantastic vintage shops!

Study the still lifes in th long gallery, through this link (here) try and work out exactly why each object may have been chosen for the painting. Deconstruct the image to discover more about the patron.

<% elsif @mood == 'stressed' && @recomendation == 'icons' %>
find the Fragonard's 'The Swing' on the first floor; try and work out exactly who this painting was created for  why, what is the purpose of the dog and the man in he bushes?

check out the amazing collection of armour in the lower gallerys, try and imagine wearing one of those suits day in dayout walking hundreds of miles to battle

the impressionist work, on the first floor to the right as you walk in the main entrance, or Turner's 'Rain, Steam and Speed' in room 39.

<% elsif @mood =='contemplative' && @recomendation == 'concepts' %>
study the pre-renaissance style of painting in the Sainsbury wing, ask the attendents about the visual consequences of the workshop practice. In particular look at the Wilton Dyptych

admire the fantastic glass scultpture by Chihuly in the entrance hall. His Rotunda Chandelier was made for the gallery in 2001 and constructed entirely of blown glass. Each peice is secured individually to the center, it is 27 ft tall and weight in at 3800lb.

The glass collections are wonderful, from modern peices to medieval stained glass the colours radiating in the galleries are enough to send the veiwer into raptures. Try and find the fabled Luck of Edenhall in the glass gallery, a beautiful cup brimming with tales and myths.

Go to the Islamic Middle East galleries on the ground floor to look at the amazing art from the Middle East and North Africa. Ranging from the 7th to the 20th century some of the patterns are equisit in detail and colour. Compare the development of visual culture of the East with that of the more famous Itaian Renaissance in the West.
